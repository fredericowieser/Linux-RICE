# Linux-RICE

## Introduction

The following repository is a collection of my linux RICE builds. Which comes from inspiration from the r/unixporn sub-reddit. I have also below listed resources which have helped me in forming my current workflow setup and have imporved my overall experience with my persoanl computer. A small recomendation I would give to those who are new to seting up customised linux builds is that their is definitely a learning curve with all of this and a fair amount of theory one should be aware of. I will attempt to give people this theory in the following document.
